# Ridiculously Simple Chrome Extension

A ridiculously simple Chrome extension boilerplate for when you just want to start making stuff.

Sets the background of www.google.com to blue and shows an alert after communicating between the content page and the background page.

## Setup

Go to chrome://extensions, make sure developer mode is turned on and load this source as an Unpacked Extension.

## Why did I do this?

This is part of a series of ridiculously simple, executable code examples. 

Sometimes we need to cut through the documentation jungle and start making stuff.
